# Blackjack Client

Connects to a RESTful Blackjack server to play blackjack.

`BlackjackClient.java` is a simple command line client.

`BlackjackClientGUI.java` is a framework for building a simple GUI client.

You can try to build a command-line client that counts cards.

Or you can build a GUI client that looks great and provides a great user experience.

## Server commands
Our server is behind the campus firewall so you can only see it on campus.

You can see the full API here:

http://euclid.knox.edu:8080/api/blackjack/swagger-ui/index.html

Again, this only works on campus.

Here is the REST API:
![API](.github/images/blackjack-api.png)

Remember that the {id} in the URL is the session id of the game you are playing.

So this URL as a post would start a new session:

```
http://euclid.knox.edu:8080/api/blackjack/start?username=superman&password=12347
```

And you would get back a JSON file that looks something like this:
```
{
  "sessionId": "fb2e4f1c-0aa4-4157-96b5-4692f47cc801",
  "playerCards": [],
  "playerValue": 0,
  "dealerCards": [],
  "dealerValue": 0,
  "phase": "BETTING",
  "outcome": null,
  "balance": 0,
  "currentBet": 10,
  "canHit": false,
  "canStand": false,
  "gameOver": false,
  "cardsRemaining": 52,
  "reShuffled": false
}
```

The file `ClientConnector.java` handles all of the
communication with the server. It converts the JSON
response into an instance of the `GameState` class.
